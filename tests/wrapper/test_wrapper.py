        We signal to other processors that we're done by writing an empty line
        to STDOUT. The finalizer parameter to spew() must be executed before that,
        as there can be processors that depend on us finishing our processing
        before they're able to run. For example, a processor that depends on
        `dump_to_zip` must wait until it has finished writing to the local
        filesystem.
